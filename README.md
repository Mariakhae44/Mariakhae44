- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mariakhae44
- 👀 I’m interested in getting started in the Tech Industry as a Data Analyst!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Structured Query Language (SQL) in SQLite then applying that to my company's choice of RDBMS.
- 🎾 In my free time, I like to play tennis, go to the gym, go to the dog park with my pup, Zuko, and find any excuse to go to the beach :)
